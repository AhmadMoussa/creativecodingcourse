## Overview for Week 1

This is a short course about P5JS that serves the purpose of being overvieable. Here you can find all course relevant material.

- **Intro to P5JS:** A first look at what P5JS is, and a showcase of some of the things that can be done with it.
- **Flow of a P5 Program:** An overview of the two main functions in P5JS, the setup() and draw() functions.
- **Creating the Canvas:** An overview of how to create and customize the canvas in P5JS, including setting its size and background color.
- **Drawing Functions:** Some of the drawing functions that P5JS provides for you to use and draw shapes to the canvas, such as line(), rect(), ellipse(), and more.
- **Creating a Grid:** Techniques for creating a grid layout on the canvas, including loops and coordinate systems.
- **Patterns with Grids:** Exploring how to create patterns and designs using grid layouts, incorporating repetition and variation.
- **Circle Packing Example:** A step-by-step example of circle packing, demonstrating how to fill a canvas with non-overlapping circles of varying sizes.


## What is Creative Coding?

Creative coding is a practice that involves using computer programming as a medium for artistic expression. Unlike traditional programming, which focuses primarily on functionality and problem-solving, creative coding emphasizes aesthetics, experimentation, and the creation of visual, auditory, or interactive experiences. Here are some key aspects of creative coding:

1. **Artistic Expression**: Creative coding merges the realms of technology and art, allowing artists, designers, and hobbyists to create digital artworks, generative designs, animations, and interactive installations.

2. **Exploration and Experimentation**: This field encourages a playful and exploratory approach to coding, often prioritizing process over a fixed end goal. This can lead to unexpected and innovative outcomes.

3. **Interactivity**: Many creative coding projects involve user interaction, making the audience an integral part of the experience. This can include interactive installations, web-based artworks, and games.

4. **Generative Art**: A significant aspect of creative coding is generative art, where artists use algorithms to generate pieces that can vary and evolve over time. These algorithms can produce unique results every time they are run.

5. **Tools and Frameworks**: There are several popular tools and frameworks designed for creative coding, such as Processing, p5.js, OpenFrameworks, and TouchDesigner. These tools provide accessible ways for artists to get started with coding and create complex works.

6. **Community and Collaboration**: Creative coding has a vibrant and supportive community. Artists often share their work and code, participate in hackathons, and collaborate on projects, contributing to a rich ecosystem of shared knowledge and inspiration.

7. **Cross-disciplinary Nature**: Creative coding often intersects with other fields such as music, architecture, dance, and science, leading to cross-disciplinary projects that push the boundaries of traditional art forms.

Overall, creative coding is about harnessing the power of code to push creative boundaries and explore new forms of digital expression.
