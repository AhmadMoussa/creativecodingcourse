This section provides an overview of the project requirements.

### Before you Start

Before you start programming, think about what you want to do. Find inspirations, and figure out what it is that you would like to express with your creation. For this purpose it is best to ask yourself some questions:

1. What do I want to make? What kind of art do I want to make?
2. What do I want to express with my creation? What is the general idea behind it?
3. How difficult is it to realize my idea? What sort of code/algorithm do I need to realize it?

If you want inspiration you can explore these three following websites:


### Experiment and Explore

If you have an idea, it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to realize that idea 100% - making art is often like exploring and discovering things. You might ultimately end up with something completely different from the idea that you had initially. It's mainly about having fun here.

There is a great article by Amy Goodchild on this topic, in which she asks

### Document your Progress

Documenting the things that you learn is very important - for yourself and for others. While you are working on your project:

- Bookmark the interesting resources you find
- Make note of the interesting ideas you have
- Write and explain to yourself why you are doing what you are doing
- Make sketches of the artwork that you see in your mind
- Write down pseudo-code in your notebook

### Objectives

The outcome of this project are the following:

1. Create a simple sketch/program that creates (~500 words)
2. Write a short text  words about the (~500 words)
3. Write a short text explaining  (~500 words)

These don't need to be perfect, in the end this is just an exercise.
