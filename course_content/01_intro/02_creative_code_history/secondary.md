A good resource on the web to learn about the history of creative coding, specifically about generative art is [Le Random's timeline](https://timeline.lerandom.art/), where they have compiled a timeline of all important moments in the past decades.

You can learn about the creation of Processing/P5JS directly from the two original creators Casey Reas and Ben Fry in this article: [A Modern Prometheus](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/a-modern-prometheus-59aed94abe85)

There is also a Daniel Schiffman video on the topic here:
