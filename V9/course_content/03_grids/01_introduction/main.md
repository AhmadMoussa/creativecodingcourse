### What are grids and what are they useful for?

Grids are frameworks that divide a space into smaller, equally sized sections, typically using horizontal and vertical lines. They are commonly used in design, architecture, and mathematics to organize content, align elements, and create balanced layouts. In design, grids help structure visual information, ensuring consistency and harmony in the placement of text, images, and other elements.

Grids are useful because they provide a clear and organized way to arrange content, making it easier to read and navigate. They help designers create aesthetically pleasing layouts, maintain alignment, and ensure that all elements are proportionately sized and positioned. Grids are essential in web design, print media, and various forms of visual communication, as they enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of the design.
