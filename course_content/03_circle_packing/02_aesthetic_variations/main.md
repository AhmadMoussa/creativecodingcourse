## Aesthetic Variations

Now that we've made a basic circle packing sketch we can play around with the aesthetics of it, and make some variations. There are a lot of things that we can do here actually.

### Colorful Circles

For example we can give our circles a color:

### Wobbly Strokes




### Connective Lines

Or we can go into a completely different direction by connecting the individual circle with lines depending on their distance to each other.
