The basic structure of a P5.js program revolves around two primary functions: `setup()` and `draw()`. These functions help manage the initialization and continuous execution of the code, respectively.

### Basic Structure of a P5.js Program

1. **Setup Function: `setup()`**
   - **Purpose**: The `setup()` function is called once when the program starts. It's used to define initial environment properties such as screen size, background color, and to load media such as images and fonts.
   - **Common Uses**: Setting up the canvas, initializing variables, loading resources, and performing any preparation work that only needs to happen once.

   ```javascript
   function setup() {
     createCanvas(400, 400); // Creates a 400x400 pixel canvas
     background(220); // Sets the background color to a light gray
   }
   ```

2. **Draw Function: `draw()`**
   - **Purpose**: The `draw()` function continuously executes the lines of code contained inside its block until the program is stopped. Itâ€™s used to create animations, update visuals, and handle interactive elements.
   - **Common Uses**: Drawing shapes, updating positions of objects, handling animations, and responding to user input.

   ```javascript
   function draw() {
     background(220); // Clears the canvas with a light gray background
     ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50); // Draws a circle at the current mouse position
   }
   ```

### Example Breakdown

Here's a simple example to illustrate the basic structure and functionality of `setup()` and `draw()`:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400); // Create a canvas of size 400x400 pixels
  background(220); // Set initial background color to light gray
}

function draw() {
  background(220); // Clear the canvas each frame
  fill(255, 0, 0); // Set the fill color to red
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50); // Draw a red circle that follows the mouse
}
```

### Key Points:

- **Initialization with `setup()`**:
  - `createCanvas(400, 400)`: This function creates a drawing canvas of width 400 pixels and height 400 pixels.
  - `background(220)`: Sets the background color to light gray. This is typically called in `setup()` for initial background setup.

- **Continuous Execution with `draw()`**:
  - `background(220)`: Calling this inside `draw()` ensures that the canvas is cleared each frame, preventing trails from previous frames.
  - `fill(255, 0, 0)`: Sets the fill color for shapes to red.
  - `ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50)`: Draws an ellipse (circle) with a diameter of 50 pixels at the current mouse position (`mouseX`, `mouseY`). This updates every frame, making the circle follow the mouse cursor.

### Additional Functions:

P5.js also provides other lifecycle functions and event handlers:
- **`mousePressed()`, `keyPressed()`, etc.**: Functions that handle specific user interactions.
- **`preload()`**: Used for loading external assets before `setup()` is called.

By using `setup()` for initialization and `draw()` for continuous execution, P5.js provides a straightforward yet powerful framework for creating interactive and dynamic visual content.
