Before we talk about grids, let's first have a look at a programming concept that we'll be using for our purposes: for loops! In JavaScript, and many other programming languages, a `for` loop is a way to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. It's basically like saying, "Do this thing over and over until I tell you to stop." 


### Basic for Loop

Here's what the basic structure of a `for` loop in javascript would look like:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // code to run repeatedly
}
```

- **Initialization**: This is where you set up a starting point. Usually, you create a variable (like `let i = 0`) to keep track of how many times you've looped.
- **Condition**: Before each loop, JavaScript checks this condition. If it's true, the loop runs; if it's false, the loop stops. The condition often involves the variable from the initialization step.
- **Update**: After each loop, JavaScript updates your variable (like `i++`, which means "add 1 to i"). This brings you closer to stopping the loop.

### Example
As an example, let's say we want to print the numbers from 1 to 5 onto the javascript console, we could do it manually by writing out the individual console.log() statement:

```javascript
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log(4);
console.log(5);
```

Or, we could use a for loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

1. **Initialization (`let i = 1`)**: Start with `i` equal to 1.
2. **Condition (`i <= 5`)**: Check if `i` is 5 or less. If yes, run the loop. If no, stop.
3. **Code Block (`console.log(i)`)**: Inside the loop, print the current value of `i`.
4. **Update (`i++`)**: Add 1 to `i`.

And this loop would print the following:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

- The loop starts by setting a variable.
- It checks a condition to see if it should keep going.
- If the condition is true, it runs the code and updates the variable.
- It stops when the condition is false.

And that's a basic `for` loop! It's a handy way to repeat actions a set number of times.

### Nested for Loops

Nesting for loops means putting one for loop inside another. This is useful when you need to handle multiple layers of data. Imagine you have a grid or table where you want to look at each cell. The outer loop can represent the rows, and the inner loop can represent the columns. For example, if you want to print out all pairs of numbers from 1 to 3, you would use a nested loop. The outer loop might start with i equal to 1, and for each value of i, the inner loop runs completely, going through j values from 1 to 3. This setup allows you to explore every combination of i and j.

```
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    console.log(`i = ${i}, j = ${j}`);
  }
}
```

So, the first time the outer loop runs, it sets i to 1, and then the inner loop runs, printing pairs like (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). Once the inner loop is done, the outer loop increments i to 2, and the inner loop runs again with the new value, printing (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). This continues until all pairs are printed, giving you a full set of combinations.

### Other types of loops

In addition to for loops, JavaScript offers several other types of loops that are handy in different situations.

A while loop, for example, keeps running as long as a certain condition is true. You might use this when you don’t know beforehand how many times you need to loop but you do know when to stop. It’s like saying, “Keep doing this until something changes.” If you want to count from 1 to 5, you could start with i equal to 1 and say, “while i is 5 or less, print i and then add 1 to i.”

Then there’s the do...while loop, which is very similar to the while loop, but with one key difference: it always runs at least once. Even if the condition is false right from the start, the loop still runs the code block before checking the condition. This can be useful in situations where you want to ensure that some code runs before you start the loop’s condition checks.

You also have loops like for...in and for...of, which are specialized for dealing with objects and arrays, respectively. The for...in loop is great when you want to go through the properties of an object, checking each key and its associated value. On the other hand, the for...of loop is designed for iterating over iterable objects, such as arrays or strings, allowing you to work with each element directly.

These different loops—for, while, do...while, for...in, and for...of—give you a lot of flexibility in your code. They allow you to repeat actions in different ways depending on what you need, whether it's a specific number of times, until a condition changes, or to go through items in a collection. By understanding how they work, you can choose the best loop for any given task.
