If you want to learn more about P5JS I recommend checking out their recently revamped webpage where you can find a variety of different tutorials and learning resources:

- [P5.js Main Website](https://p5js.org/)
- Make sure to check out the tutorials section [P5.js Tutorials Page](https://p5js.org/tutorials)
- And the examples section that provides inspiration [P5.js Examples Page](https://p5js.org/examples/)

I also recommend checking out OpenProcessing, a website that makes it possible for code artists to share their creations with each other - on the discover tab of the website you can explore thousands of examples: [OpenProcessing Discover](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending)

Daniel Shiffman's popular creative coding YouTube channel, The Coding Train, also has a wealth of tutorials on P5.js. He covers topics ranging from basics to advanced techniques, including transformations and managing drawing states :

- Although primarily focused on simulations and natural systems, and a bit more advanced, Daniel Shiffman's written a book titled Nature of Code, in which he covers fundamental programming concepts in a visual context using P5.js and Processing: [Nature of Code - Book and Online Tutorials](https://natureofcode.com/)
